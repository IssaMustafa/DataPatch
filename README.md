# Missing Data Imputation and Model Training
**DataPatch**
This project focuses on handling missing data in datasets by training machine learning models to impute values. It provides an automated pipeline for missing value imputation, model selection, and evaluation.

## Features
- Detect and handle missing data.
- Train machine learning models to predict missing values.
- Support for classification and regression tasks.
- Customizable model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
- Save the processed dataset for further use.
